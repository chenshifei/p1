    <p><cite>Jabberwocky</cite> is a nonsense poem written by Lewis
      Carroll about the killing of an animal called <q>the
      Jabberwock</q>.  It was included in his 1871 novel <q>Through
      the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There</q>, the sequel
      to <cite>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</cite>. The book tells
      of Alice’s adventures within the back-to-front world of a
      Looking-Glass Land.</p>
    
    <p>In an early scene in which she first encounters the chess piece
      characters White King and White Queen, Alice finds a book
      written in a seemingly unintelligible language. Realising that
      she is travelling through an inverted world, she recognises that
      the verses on the pages are written in mirror-writing. She holds
      a mirror to one of the poems and reads the reflected verse
      of <q>Jabberwocky</q>. She finds the nonsense verse as puzzling
      as the odd land she has passed into, later revealed as a
      dreamscape.</p>
    
    <p><q>Jabberwocky</q> is considered one of the greatest nonsense
      poems written in English. Its playful, whimsical language has
      given English nonsense words and neologisms such
      as <q>galumphing</q> and <q>chortle</q>.</p>
